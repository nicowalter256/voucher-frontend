## API Integration

This app is designed to work with the [MoWave Voucher Backend](https://voucher-backend-1.onrender.com).

### Key Endpoints Used

- `POST /auth/login` â€” User login
- `POST /auth/register` â€” User registration
- `GET /vouchers` â€” List vouchers
- `POST /vouchers/generate` â€” Generate a new voucher
- `POST /payments/init` â€” Initiate a payment
- `GET /payments/my` â€” List user payments

> **Note:** All authenticated endpoints require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

## Usage

- **Login/Register**: Create an account or sign in with your credentials.
- **Voucher Management**: Generate new vouchers, search/filter, and copy codes.
- **Payments**: Initiate payments for unused vouchers and view your payment history.
- **Dashboard**: Click the dashboard card to view the system architecture and project progress.
- **Navigation**: Seamlessly switch between voucher management and dashboard views.

## Development Notes

- **Config**: API endpoints and storage keys are managed in `src/config.js`.
- **API Utilities**: All API calls use `src/utils/api.js` for authentication and error handling.
- **Toast System**: Global toast notifications are available via `window.showToast()`.
- **Routing**: Simple view state management is used instead of React Router for this version.
- **Error Handling**: Handles 201 Created responses and non-JSON responses gracefully.

## Customization

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes can be customized in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Icons**: Uses [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for all icons.
- **Backend**: You can point the API base URL to your own backend in `src/config.js`.
